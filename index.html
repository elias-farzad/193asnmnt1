      Do you ever feel like you aren't learning enough from <strong><a href="https://leetcode.com">Leetcode?</a></strong> Do you wish you had someone over your shoulder to <strong>help you?</strong> Or perhaps a mock interviewer to help you <strong>prepare for interviewers?</strong> Look no forther. You have come to the right place. learn to <strong>eat code rather than leetcode.</strong>
